This is an static application I created for learning React Native. It has a login screen, register screen, and a multi-main screen which is controlled by a BottomNavigationView: 
- Cards: It reads a JSON from my github.io website so I can check the login's data and show cats in my homemade tinder for cats.
- Edit Profile: Shows the basic information of your cat for modifying it.
- Contact: Shows a mobile number, an email and an address.
